But, you've got to find out, from each state, probably down to the local area, how they have defined Tech Prep. There are some Tech Prep programs out there that look very close to a Program of Study as defined in the legislation, and then as further expanded upon in the framework that OVAE [Office of Vocational and Adult Education] came out with. But I would say few and far between. Does Omaha have youth options? And how is the district teamed up with local nonprofits to gain experience and serve the community? Ken Spellman : We don't have a whole lot of youth options. We have teamed with local nonprofits. We participate-and it's either a seven day or three-day community service project-with our local postsecondary institution. It's a four-year college at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where we'll collaborate with primarily their construction students. We will go out and work with nonprofit organizations during that seven days of service. We're looking at having a service learning requirement as part of our graduation process, but that's just in draft form right now. Is there any evidence that Programs of Study undermine liberal education requirements in community college? For example, might they allow someone to get a business-related credential without an associate's degree? Kim Green : I think that the notion of a Program of Study is to allow a student to have options. And so in that case, you wouldn't have a case where someone would earn a business credential and not be eligible to also move forward and get their associate's degree. It's not one or the other. In fact the purpose or intent of a Program of Study is to make sure that the student is prepared and aware of all of the next steps that they might take. Ivan Charner : I would add, though, that if it was a true Program of Study, then the business-related credential should have in it both academic and technical requirements. So those should be part of the Program of Study even if it at a point is going to help somebody get a business-related credential and not the associate's degree. I would agree with Kim that the student always has to be viewing what are the possible next steps educationally, but even if they ended at this particular time or at a particular time with a business-related credential, there should be a balance between career and technical on the one side and academic on the other side in their courses. Karen Spencer-May : We do have that [someone getting a credential without an associate's degree] happening sometimes, but we strongly suggest to the kids that they get an associate's degree. To have just a credential doesn't give you a lot. It just gives you enough to get inside the door of any type of new job. So, we truly, truly work with our kids to understand that an associate's degree is a much better route for them and sometimes then on to a bachelor's degree if it's within the right area. ? This question has several parts. How are technical skill assessments being integrated into Programs of Study? How are these skills being defined? Through what means are they being assessed? When do these technical skill assessments occur? Are they differentiated by grade level and skill level as students are moving through the program? Ivan Charner :? The answer to the first part is, the definition of a Program of Study requires technical skills to be assessed. So it needs to absolutely be integrated into Programs of Study just like the academic skills need to be assessed. So the remainder of the answer comes to the challenge of where they're defined, how they're defined and how they're assessed are determined by the particular Program of Study and the agreement between the secondary, postsecondary, and others in the community. Corinne Alfeld : What I've seen is that the instructors at each level, the secondary and postsecondary levels, use a lot of performance-based assessments to assess technical skills. They will have a lab activity or something where students have to demonstrate what they've learned, and that is a part of what the technical skills assessments are. But there are also industry-based assessments and third-party-created technical assessments that are used widely as well. Kim Green : I would just add, I think what is challenging about this series of questions and the whole discussion about technical skills assessments is the fact that we don't really have a system of technical skills assessments. What we have are a whole bunch of occupation-specific assessments that exist. And in many ways there is a disconnect between the assessments that exist, which are pretty occupation-specific, and the broader definition of Program of Study that you might eventually get to occupation-specific. But there's a whole lot of other stuff that happens that is technically oriented before you might be eligible for that sitting for that technical skills assessment. And so it raises this question of how do we best measure the learning and the competency that a student gains as they move through a Program of Study that isn't, as CTE was traditionally conceived of having a sequence of Ag 1, 2, 3 and 4, but might be three courses that are from different program areas that fit very nicely together to create preparedness for an occupation. But it's not the way we've traditionally thought about how we prepare students for occupations. And so there's this disconnect of where we're moving with how students are packaging their education through Programs of Study and what assessments exist out there. And I think that's one of the challenges that local communities and states are facing as they try to move forward with both being accountable for their programs and trying to be innovative by implementing more Programs of Study. I don't know that there's a solution. It's certainly something that a lot of people are talking about and we're aware of and trying to work toward a solution. But there isn't one set one that exists at this point. H ow about technical skills assessment specifically in Omaha? Ken Spellman : Yes, we do incorporate technical skill assessments into our Programs of Study. We have numerous advisory boards that advise us on that. There are our state and national technical skills that we identify and that we use. And what means do we [use to] assess them? We're really striving for either dual enrollment opportunities for our students or standards-based programs and technical-standards-based programs, where we have programs such as the Certified Nursing Assistant program that our students go through and then actually complete their CNA degree. We participate in Cisco, the information technology company, and their certification. We have programs that are nationally certified such as the National Automotive Technology Education Foundation, our NATEF program in our automotive areas, also, and so we really strive. And we do some things with the culinary, the ProStart National, and their skills as well. And how do we assess them? Sometimes it's actually a national certificated test that we use, such as the CNA, to assess those students. When do these assessments happen? Primarily these assessments happen during their senior year, during their capstone course. We primarily don't do assessments other than in their senior year; occasionally during the junior year, but primarily junior or senior year. The state of Nebraska is currently developing statewide technical skill assessments. We have academic attainments that we use for our purpose, but the state of Nebraska is currently looking at either statewide tests or standards that each of our students or programs would participate in. Regarding OPS's culinary program, did the district take the community college curriculum and teach it in the high school and is it dual credit? Karen Spencer-May : Actually we started out by creating what we thought was most appropriate for our students to learn. And one of the things that we did learn from looking at our curriculum versus the community college one was that our students went at a slower pace than the community college one did. We recently looked at a school district that was looking at increasing the number of classes that were actually dual enrollment that the culinary program at the community college used. And we were kind of concerned about that because what we found is that it took our kids more time to learn some of the skills. For example, there was a basic culinary foundations class that taught knife skills, and acquiring the skill to use knives the way a chef does takes much longer than we would have ever anticipated. At the community college, the kids would actually maybe take the class two, three, four times before they developed the skill level to pass. And so, what we were finding was that we needed to go at a slower pace, so that our kids could get the skills that they needed for this. We have three dual credit classes that we actually put into our curriculum; the rest of it is other parts that we felt were important for kids to know. In a Beginning Foods class, we felt like we wanted kids to learn how to cook at home and then to take those skills on to the culinary field. And so, we thought it was important for us to look at what was most important for us to have, what we felt was most important for us to have in our curriculum. And then to take and fit in the community college curriculum where it was most appropriate. So, we do teach those three classes, but it's not until the end because it just was too difficult for our kids to pass it at an earlier age-and it is dual credit. This next question received during the Webinar has a few parts. How are districts and schools aligning community college and high school curricula? Is the community college curriculum being taught in high school? And how is dual credit being awarded? Corinne, can you address that? Corinne Alfeld : I spoke earlier about the way that the faculty are working together to align the curriculum with the content and skills that students have to have");
